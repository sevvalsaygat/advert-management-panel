# ReactJS Advertisement Management Project

-This is a React JS and Next JS-based advertisement management project that allows users to effectively manage their ads. The application is developed using Next.js and React.js, state management is handled with Zustand, and a modern UI is created using tailwindCSS. Users can add ads to favorites, sort them, increase favorite counts, delete ads, and add new advertisements. The homepage highlights the latest ads and provides users with an user-friendly interface.

## Important Note!:

Photos are encoded with base64, taking up significant space in localStorage and limiting the number of ads we can fetch due to exceeding the capacity of localStorage. This is not a systemic issue but rather a result of exceeding localStorage capacity.
